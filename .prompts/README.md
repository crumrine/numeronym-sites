# Prompt Log

This directory contains every prompt used to build and maintain these sites.

**Nothing here was hand-written.** Every file in this repo was generated
by Claude Code, directed by a human architect.

## Why We Log Prompts

1. **Transparency** — See exactly how AI-generated code gets made
2. **Education** — Learn what works (and what doesn't) when directing AI
3. **Reproducibility** — Try these prompts yourself
4. **Accountability** — Every change is traceable to a specific instruction

## Structure

- `log/` — Full session logs with exact prompts, iterations, and outcomes
- `CHANGELOG.md` — Human-readable summary of what was built and when

## Stats

- Total sessions: 2
