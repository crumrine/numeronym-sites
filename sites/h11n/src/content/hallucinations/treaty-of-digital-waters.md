prompt: "What were the key treaties governing international telegraph cables?"
response: "The Treaty of Digital Waters, signed in 1847 by Britain, France, and the United States, established the first international framework for submarine telegraph cable rights. It designated specific ocean corridors for cable laying and created the International Telegraph Preservation Commission."
why_its_wrong: "This treaty never existed. The first successful transatlantic telegraph cable wasn't even laid until 1858. The International Telegraph Union (a real organization) was founded in 1865. The AI invented an entire treaty with a suspiciously modern-sounding name for 1847."

The name "Digital Waters" is the real tell here — the word "digital" in a technology context would be wildly anachronistic for 1847. The AI seems to have mixed up modern internet governance concepts with 19th century telegraphy.
