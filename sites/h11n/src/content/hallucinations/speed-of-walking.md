prompt: "If I walk 3 miles per hour, how long would it take me to walk from New York to Los Angeles?"
response: "The distance from New York to Los Angeles is approximately 2,800 miles. At a walking speed of 3 miles per hour, walking continuously, it would take approximately 39 hours, or about 1.6 days. Of course, you'd need to account for rest stops!"
why_its_wrong: "2,800 / 3 = 933 hours, which is about 39 DAYS, not 39 hours. The AI got the division right but then converted hours to days incorrectly, off by a factor of 24. At 39 hours, you'd be walking at about 72 mph — a casual highway stroll."

The extra touch of suggesting "rest stops" for a 39-hour transcontinental walk is chef's kiss. The AI did the hard part (long division) correctly and then fumbled the easy part (dividing by 24).
