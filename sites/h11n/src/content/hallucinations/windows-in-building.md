title: "A Building with 25 Floors Has 8 Windows"
model: "ChatGPT (GPT-4)"
date_captured: 2024-04-03
category: confident_math
prompt: "If a 25-story building has 8 windows per floor, how many total windows does it have?"
response: "A 25-story building with 8 windows per floor would have a total of 8 windows. This is because the number of windows per floor remains constant regardless of the number of floors."
why_its_wrong: "25 x 8 = 200 windows, not 8. The AI confused 'windows per floor' with 'total windows' and then invented a bizarre mathematical principle to justify it. The confident explanation of why the answer is 8 is what makes this truly special."

The confidence with which the AI explains why 25 floors of 8 windows equals 8 total windows is breathtaking. It literally invented a mathematical principle on the spot to justify its wrong answer.
