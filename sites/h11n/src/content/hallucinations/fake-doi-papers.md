prompt: "Cite peer-reviewed papers on the effects of social media on teenage mental health"
response: "Key studies include: Thompson, R. & Williams, K. (2021). 'Digital Minds: Social Media's Impact on Adolescent Neural Development.' Journal of Digital Psychology, 45(3), 112-128. DOI: 10.1016/j.jdp.2021.03.004. Also see: Garcia, M. et al. (2022). 'Scrolling Toward Sadness: A Meta-Analysis.' Annual Review of Cyberpsychology, 8(1), 45-67."
why_its_wrong: "Neither paper exists. The 'Journal of Digital Psychology' is not a real journal. The 'Annual Review of Cyberpsychology' is not a real publication. The DOI leads nowhere. The authors, titles, volume numbers, and page ranges are all fabricated. Every single element of these citations is made up."

This is one of the most dangerous types of hallucination because it looks exactly like real academic citations. Volume numbers, page ranges, DOIs — all the formatting is perfect. Only the content is completely fictional.
