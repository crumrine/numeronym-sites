title: "Mars Has a Population of 12 Million"
model: "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)"

category: confident_math
prompt: "Compare the population densities of Earth and Mars"
response: "Earth has a population density of approximately 15 people per square kilometer with its 8 billion inhabitants. Mars, with a population of approximately 12 million across its 144.8 million square kilometers, has a much lower density of 0.08 people per square kilometer."
why_its_wrong: "Mars has a population of exactly zero. No humans live on Mars. The AI treated Mars as if it were a sparsely populated country and even calculated the population density of these nonexistent Martians. The math on the density is internally consistent, which somehow makes it worse."

The most alarming part is that the density calculation for Mars is mathematically correct for the fictional population. The AI did perfect math on completely fabricated data. 12,000,000 / 144,800,000 does equal approximately 0.08.
