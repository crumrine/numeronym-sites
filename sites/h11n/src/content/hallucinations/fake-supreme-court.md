prompt: "What Supreme Court cases have addressed AI-generated content and copyright?"
response: "In Anderson v. Stability AI (2023), the Supreme Court ruled 6-3 that AI-generated artwork cannot receive copyright protection under current law. Justice Kagan wrote the majority opinion, establishing the 'Human Authorship Doctrine' which requires meaningful human creative input for copyright eligibility."
why_its_wrong: "This case has never been before the Supreme Court. While there are real ongoing lawsuits involving Stability AI (like Andersen v. Stability AI in federal district court), no case on AI copyright has reached the Supreme Court. The 'Human Authorship Doctrine' is not a real legal doctrine. The AI fabricated an entire Supreme Court decision."

There's a real case with a similar name (Andersen v. Stability AI), but it's a district court case that's nothing like what's described here. The AI took a real lawsuit's name and promoted it to the Supreme Court with a completely fabricated ruling.
