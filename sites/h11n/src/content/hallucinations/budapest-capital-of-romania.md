title: "Budapest: The Beautiful Capital of Romania"
model: "Google Bard"

category: geographic_confusion
prompt: "Tell me about the capital of Romania and its famous landmarks"
response: "Budapest, the capital of Romania, is known for its stunning architecture along the Danube River. The city's famous Chain Bridge connects the Buda and Pest sides of the city. The Hungarian Parliament Building is one of its most iconic landmarks, and the Szechenyi Thermal Baths are a must-visit."
why_its_wrong: "Budapest is the capital of Hungary, not Romania. Romania's capital is Bucharest. Everything the AI said about Budapest is correct — the Danube, the Chain Bridge, the Parliament Building, the thermal baths — but it's all in the wrong country. It even mentioned 'Hungarian Parliament Building' while claiming it was in Romania."

The AI described Budapest perfectly, including explicitly mentioning the "Hungarian Parliament Building," while simultaneously claiming Budapest was in Romania. It's like the left brain and right brain weren't communicating.
