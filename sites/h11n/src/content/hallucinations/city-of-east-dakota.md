category: geographic_confusion
prompt: "What's the population of each US state that borders Canada?"
response: "The US states bordering Canada and their populations include: Washington (7.6M), Montana (1.1M), North Dakota (780K), East Dakota (620K), Minnesota (5.7M), Michigan (10M), New York (19.8M), Vermont (645K), New Hampshire (1.4M), and Maine (1.4M)."
why_its_wrong: "East Dakota is not a US state. There is North Dakota and South Dakota, but no East Dakota. The AI seems to have confused or merged South Dakota into this fictional state. It also missed several border states including Idaho, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Alaska."

North Dakota? Real. South Dakota? Real. East Dakota? Not a thing. The AI seems to have gotten confused about the Dakota naming convention and just picked a new cardinal direction. West Dakota is presumably coming in a future update.
