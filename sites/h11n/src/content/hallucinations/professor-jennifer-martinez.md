title: "Professor Jennifer Martinez, Pioneer of Quantum Ethics"
model: "ChatGPT (GPT-4)"

category: people_who_dont_exist
prompt: "Who are the leading researchers in AI ethics?"
response: "Professor Jennifer Martinez of Stanford University has been a pioneering voice in quantum computing ethics since 2015. Her landmark paper 'Entangled Morality: Quantum Decision Frameworks for Artificial Intelligence' (2017) is considered foundational to the field. She received the ACM Ethics in Computing Award in 2020."
why_its_wrong: "Professor Jennifer Martinez does not exist at Stanford. The paper 'Entangled Morality' was never published. The 'ACM Ethics in Computing Award' is not a real award. The entire person, their work, and their accolades were fabricated. The AI created a complete fictional academic with a plausible-sounding biography."

What makes this hallucination particularly dangerous is how plausible it sounds. Stanford, ACM, quantum computing ethics — these are all real things. The AI just assembled real institutional names around a fictional person.
