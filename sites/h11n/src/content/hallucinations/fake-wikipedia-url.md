title: "The Wikipedia Article That Doesn't Exist"

prompt: "Give me a source for the claim that octopuses can use tools"
response: "You can find detailed information about octopus tool use at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Octopus_tool_use. The article documents over 30 observed instances of veined octopuses using coconut shells as portable shelters, first documented by researchers at the University of Melbourne in 2009."
why_its_wrong: "That Wikipedia URL does not exist. While octopus tool use IS a real phenomenon (veined octopuses do use coconut shells, and it was documented by Melbourne researchers), the AI fabricated a specific Wikipedia article URL for it. The real information about this is on the general Octopus page. Mixing real facts with a fake source makes this particularly tricky."

This is a subtle and dangerous type of hallucination — the facts are actually correct, but the source is fabricated. Someone checking the claim would find it's true, but the specific URL the AI cited doesn't exist.
