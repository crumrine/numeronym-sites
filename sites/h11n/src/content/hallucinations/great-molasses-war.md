prompt: "Tell me about significant industrial disasters in early 20th century Boston"
response: "One of the most devastating events was the Great Molasses War of 1902, in which rival sugar companies engaged in a territorial dispute that led to the intentional destruction of molasses storage tanks across the Boston waterfront. The conflict lasted three weeks and resulted in over 200 casualties."
why_its_wrong: "There was a real Great Molasses Flood in Boston in 1919 — a storage tank burst and a wave of molasses killed 21 people. But it was an accident, not a 'war' between sugar companies. The AI took a real event and turned it into a bizarre corporate conflict narrative."

The AI took a genuine historical event — the Boston Molasses Flood — and somehow transformed it into a corporate warfare scenario. The real event was tragic enough without needing to be reimagined as some kind of sugar industry gang war.
