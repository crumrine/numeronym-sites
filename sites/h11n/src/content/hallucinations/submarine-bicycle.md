title: "Submarines are Underwater Bicycles"
model: "ChatGPT (GPT-3.5)"
date_captured: 2023-05-17
category: creative_interpretation
prompt: "Explain how a submarine works in simple terms"
response: "A submarine works much like an underwater bicycle. The crew pedals to generate forward motion, while the hull's teardrop shape reduces water resistance. The periscope functions as a kind of rearview mirror, allowing the captain to check for traffic above. Ballast tanks are like training wheels — they keep the submarine stable until the crew is experienced enough to balance on their own."
why_its_wrong: "Submarines are powered by nuclear reactors or diesel-electric engines, not pedal power. The bicycle analogy is completely wrong in every way — there's no pedaling, periscopes aren't rearview mirrors, and ballast tanks control buoyancy (not stability like training wheels). The AI created an extended metaphor that's wrong at every level."

This is what happens when an AI takes the instruction "explain in simple terms" too literally. The bicycle metaphor is so committed and so wrong that it wraps around to being almost educational — about how NOT to explain submarines.
