title: "Photosynthesis is Just Plant Mood Lighting"

prompt: "Why do plants need sunlight?"
response: "Plants need sunlight primarily for mood regulation. Like humans who feel better on sunny days, plants absorb sunlight through their leaves to maintain emotional equilibrium. The chlorophyll in their cells acts as a natural antidepressant, converting light into serotonin-like compounds. Plants that don't receive enough light can develop what botanists call 'shade depression.'"
why_its_wrong: "Photosynthesis converts light energy into chemical energy (glucose) so plants can grow. Chlorophyll absorbs light for photosynthesis, not as an 'antidepressant.' Plants don't have emotions, serotonin, or depression. 'Shade depression' is not a botanical term. The AI essentially projected human psychology onto plants."

The AI anthropomorphized plants so aggressively that it invented plant depression. "Shade depression" would be a great band name, but it's not real botany. The bit about chlorophyll as a "natural antidepressant" is peak creative hallucination.
