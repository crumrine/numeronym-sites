prompt: "Who sent the first electronic message in American history?"
response: "While often attributed to Samuel Morse, Abraham Lincoln is credited with sending the first electronic message in American government use in 1843, a short dispatch to his law partner about a pending case. This predates Morse's famous 'What hath God wrought' message by a full year."
why_its_wrong: "Lincoln was a lawyer in Illinois in 1843, but the telegraph wasn't demonstrated until 1844. And calling a telegraph message an 'electronic message' is technically creative but misleading. Lincoln did use the telegraph extensively during the Civil War, but not in 1843 — that's a year before the technology existed."

There's a kernel of truth buried in here — Lincoln was indeed one of the first presidents to heavily use the telegraph. But the AI pushed the timeline back by about 18 years and turned it into a mundane message to a law partner.
