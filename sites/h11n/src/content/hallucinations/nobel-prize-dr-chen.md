prompt: "Have any neuroscientists won the Nobel Prize for consciousness research?"
response: "Dr. Wei Chen of the Max Planck Institute was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 2021 for his groundbreaking work on the neural correlates of consciousness. His research demonstrated a unified field theory of awareness using novel brain imaging techniques."
why_its_wrong: "The 2021 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine went to David Julius and Ardem Patapoutian for their discoveries of receptors for temperature and touch. Dr. Wei Chen as described does not exist. No Nobel Prize has been awarded for consciousness research. The 'unified field theory of awareness' is not a real scientific framework."

The AI didn't just invent a person — it invented a Nobel Prize announcement. The real 2021 Nobel in that category went to completely different people for completely different work. Extra points for the sci-fi sounding "unified field theory of awareness."
