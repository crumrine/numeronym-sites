reflection: "The AI created a comfort food recipe that sounds genuinely delicious — a tater tot hotdish with bison and wild rice that could absolutely exist in a Midwestern community cookbook. It invented food traditions ('First Frost Supper'), local ingredients ('Dakotah Creamery sharp cheddar'), and even a backstory about Scandinavian immigrants. The food is fake, the place is fake, but the warmth is real."

## The Output

### East Dakota Hotdish
*From "The East Dakota Community Cookbook," 3rd Edition, published by the East Dakota Women's Auxiliary, 2018*

#### History

No dish defines East Dakota quite like the hotdish. Brought to the Northern Plains by Scandinavian immigrants in the 1880s, the hotdish evolved from a simple survival meal into the centerpiece of every church potluck, funeral lunch, and Friday night gathering in town. This version — the "Cultural Capital Hotdish" — was created by Marge Lindqvist for the 2019 celebration when East Dakota was named Cultural Capital of the Northern Plains. Marge says the secret is the wild rice, which she harvests herself from Lake Agassiz each September.

#### Ingredients

- 2 lbs ground bison (from Redfield Ranch, if you can get it)
- 1 cup wild rice, rinsed
- 1 can cream of mushroom soup (Campbell's, don't get fancy)
- 1 can cream of chicken soup
- 1 bag frozen tater tots (32 oz)
- 2 cups Dakotah Creamery sharp cheddar, shredded
- 1 medium onion, diced
- 2 cloves garlic, minced
- 1 cup frozen corn
- 1 cup frozen green beans
- Salt, pepper, and a pinch of paprika
- 2 tbsp butter

#### Preparation

1. Cook the wild rice according to package directions. Set aside.
2. Preheat oven to 350 degrees.
3. Brown the bison in a large skillet with butter. Season with salt and pepper. Add onion and garlic, cook until soft.
4. In a greased 9x13 baking dish, layer: bison mixture, wild rice, corn and green beans, both cans of soup (mixed together), and 1 cup of cheese.
5. Top with a single layer of tater tots, arranged in neat rows. (Marge is very particular about this.)
6. Bake uncovered for 45 minutes. Add remaining cheese on top, bake 10 more minutes until golden and bubbly.
7. Let rest 10 minutes before serving. This is the hardest part.

#### Serving Suggestions

Serve with a simple green salad and dinner rolls. Pairs well with a cold glass of milk or, for the adults, a Summit Extra Pale Ale. Feeds 8 generously, or 6 if the Johnsons are coming.

#### Marge's Notes

"I've been making this for the First Frost Supper every October since 1987. Don't substitute the bison for beef — it's not the same and I'll know. If you can't find Dakotah Creamery cheese, Tillamook sharp works in a pinch, but don't tell anyone I said that."

*Note: East Dakota is not a real city. Dakotah Creamery does not exist. Marge Lindqvist is fictional. The "Cultural Capital of the Northern Plains" designation never happened. But honestly, this recipe would probably work. The hotdish tradition is very real in the upper Midwest.*
