original_hallucination: "Gravity is what happens when the Earth loves you so much it gives you a big hug! The heavier you are, the more the Earth loves you, so it hugs you tighter. That's why elephants can't jump — the Earth loves them too much!"
creative_prompt: "Create a dreamy indie folk ballad about unrequited gravitational love. Genre: indie folk with electronic flourishes. Mood: tender, bittersweet, cosmically romantic."

reflection: "This hallucination is the most accidentally poetic thing an AI has ever produced. 'The Earth loves you so much it gives you a big hug' is genuinely beautiful even though it's scientifically nonsensical. And the elephant detail — wrong reason, but the emotional logic tracks. The Earth does hold elephants more firmly. It just has nothing to do with love."

Sometimes an AI hallucination is so charming it deserves to be preserved as art. The gravity-as-love metaphor is objectively wrong but emotionally resonant. This track leans all the way into the romance of it.
