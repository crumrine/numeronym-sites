title: "Twelve Million Martians (A Density Problem)"
source_hallucination: "population-of-mars"
original_hallucination: "Mars, with a population of approximately 12 million across its 144.8 million square kilometers, has a much lower density of 0.08 people per square kilometer."
creative_prompt: "Create a lo-fi hip hop track with a space/cosmic theme. Genre: lo-fi beats with ambient space textures. Mood: lonely, contemplative, mathematically precise but existentially wrong. The track should feel like late-night studying on a planet where nobody lives."

reflection: "What kills me about this hallucination is the math is *perfect*. The AI invented 12 million Martians, then calculated their population density with flawless arithmetic. It's wrong at the foundation but correct in every subsequent step. The lo-fi track captures that vibe — something that feels right, sounds right, but is built on nothing."

This one hits different because the AI didn't just make something up — it performed correct calculations on fabricated data. The Snacks Not Found treatment felt right: a lo-fi study beats track for studying on a planet that has no students, no schools, no people. Just math.
