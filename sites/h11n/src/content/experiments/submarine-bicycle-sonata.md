title: "The Submarine Bicycle Sonata"
source_hallucination: "submarine-bicycle"
original_hallucination: "A submarine works much like an underwater bicycle. The crew pedals to generate forward motion, while the hull's teardrop shape reduces water resistance. The periscope functions as a kind of rearview mirror, allowing the captain to check for traffic above. Ballast tanks are like training wheels."
creative_prompt: "Create a cinematic instrumental track in the style of a whimsical underwater adventure. Genre: orchestral electronica. Mood: majestic yet absurd, like discovering something impossible is real. Build from a single rhythm to a full orchestral swell."

reflection: "There's something beautiful about the AI's commitment to this metaphor. It didn't just say submarines are like bicycles — it built an entire mechanical explanation where every submarine component maps to a bicycle part. The periscope as a rearview mirror is poetic. I wanted the music to capture that same energy: something that sounds grand and scientific but is fundamentally, hilariously wrong."

The submarine bicycle hallucination is peak creative interpretation — the AI wasn't confused, it was *committed*. This track takes that commitment and turns it into sound. Imagine Hans Zimmer scoring a nature documentary about a vehicle that doesn't exist.
